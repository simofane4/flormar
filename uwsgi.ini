# 1) Point `chdir` to the folder containing manage.py
chdir = /home/site/flormar

# 2) Tell uWSGI how to find your WSGI application
#    In your case, the Django project package is also called "flormar"
module = flormar.wsgi:application

# 3) Point to your virtual environment (the `env` folder)
home = /home/env

# 4) uWSGI process management settings
master = true
processes = 5

# 5) Use a socket (instead of HTTP) so Nginx (or another web server) can talk to uWSGI
socket = /home/site/flormar/flormar.sock
chmod-socket = 660

# 6) Clean up socket files when the process stops
# vacuum = true

# 7) (Optional) Log file â€” make sure the folder exists and is writable
logto = /home/site/flormar/uwsgi.log
